<B>Modularizing a Program:</B><P>

Let's look at a <A TARGET=_blank HREF="adjust1.c">program</A> that
adjusts grades.

<P>
There are some parts of the program that are <EM>generic</EM> and could
be separated out for possible reused.

<P>
<EM>What are the parts that could be separated out?</EM>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Broken Up Version:</B><P>

When we separate a set of code into a self-contained entity, we call
this a <EM>module</EM>.

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Note:</B>
A module is also sometimes called a <EM>library</EM>, although the term
library is used more for code that is in an <EM>already-compiled</EM>
form.
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
To create a C module for the <EM>grade</EM> functions, we need to
create 2 new source code files: a <CODE>.h</CODE> file and a
<CODE>.c</CODE> file.  It is typical for the base name of those files
to be the same, and to relate to the functionality of the module.
Thus, we'll name them:

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TH>
<CODE>grades.h</CODE>
</TH>
<TH>
<CODE>grades.c</CODE>
</TH>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD>
Contains stuff people <EM>calling</EM> the grade functions need to know.
</TD>
<TD>
Contains stuff people <EM>writing</EM> the grade functions need to know.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Since this module only contains the grade functions, we also need a
file for the main program--let's call it <CODE>adjust.c</CODE>.

<P>
We've already broken our original program up into these files and made
them available for you to <A HREF="download/">download</A>.  There is
also a copy of a data file (for testing) and a <EM>make file</EM> that
we'll use shortly.

<P>
Let's look at each file and discuss them in more detail...

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>grades.h</B>
<DD>
This is the <EM>interface</EM> to the module.  People who use the
module (i.e., in a main program or another module) will have to
<B>include</B> this header file.  It should only contain the public
information necessary for people to use the module--mainly, this means
it contains <EM>functional prototypes</EM> (for those functions in the
module that users of the module are allowed to access).  It may also
contain things like <EM>constants and type definitions</EM>.

<DT><B>grades.c</B>
<DD>
This is the <EM>implementation</EM> of the module.  Those who use the
grades module must link their code with this code.  It contains all the
<EM>internals</EM> of the module, such as the <EM>definitions</EM> (i.e.,
bodies) of all the functions.

<DT><B>adjust.c</B>
<DD>
The main program and <EM>user</EM> of the grades module.  Since it relies
on the grades module, it includes the grades header:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#include "grades.h"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</DL>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=left>
<B>Note:</B> 
When including a non-standard header file (like one you wrote), list
its name in double quotes (like above).  When including system header
files, list their names in angle brackets, as in:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
<EM>How does the implementation file <CODE>grades.c</CODE> get prototypes
for <CODE>PrintGrades()</CODE> and <CODE>AdjustGrades()</CODE>?</EM>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Wrapping Header Files:</B><P>

One thing is missing from our new grades module...The header should be
<EM>wrapped</EM> to prevent <EM>multiple inclusion</EM>.

<P>
Header files, like our header for the grades module (<CODE>grades.h</CODE>),
include things like: constants, new types, and functional prototypes.
This code should only be <EM>included</EM> into a <CODE>.c</CODE> file
once; otherwise, the compiler may complain and refuse to compile the
<CODE>.c</CODE> file.

<P>
You may think that including the code from a header twice would be unlikely,
in that we would rarely mistakenly do the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#include "grades.h"
<B>...</B>
#include "grades.h"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
However, multiple inclusion is often likely in the following form:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#include "grades.h"
<B>...</B>
#include "final.h"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
where <CODE>final.h</CODE> <EM>includes</EM> <CODE>grades.h</CODE>.
In this case, you might get some compiler error like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
In file included from somefile.c:17:
final.h:12: redefinition of `<EM>something</EM>'
final.h:12: `<EM>something</EM>' previously declared here
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I.e., it did not like the fact that the same thing was defined twice.

<P>
To solve the problem of multiple inclusion, we <EM>wrap</EM> the header
by doing the following...  Put the whole header inside an
<EM>if-not-defined</EM> construct, like:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">#ifndef GRADES_H
#define GRADES_H</FONT>
<B>...</B>
CONTENTS OF grades.h
<B>...</B>
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">#endif /* not defined GRADES_H */</FONT>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where <CODE>GRADES_H</CODE> is unique to the file <CODE>grades.h</CODE>.

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Aside:</B>
A typical practice to get a unique symbol (e.g., <CODE>GRADES_H</CODE>) is
to take the file name of the header (e.g., <CODE>grades.h</CODE>) and:

<UL>
<LI>change any non-alphanumeric characters to the underscore
(<CODE>_</CODE>), and
<LI>make all letters uppercase.
</UL>

<P>
This usually gives a unique symbol.
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
Being wrapped, the first time <CODE>grades.h</CODE> is included:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#include "grades.h"  /* GRADES_H not defined, but once this */
                     /* include is done it will be.         */
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

the symbol <CODE>GRADES_H</CODE> will not be defined and the code in
the header will be compiled.  Later, if the header is included again
(directly or indirectly):

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
<B>...</B>
#include "final.h"  /* This tries to include grades.h. */
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

in the same source file, then the code will be skipped since
<CODE>GRADES_H</CODE> is already defined (i.e., it got defined the
first time we included <CODE>grades.h</CODE>).

<P>
<EM>
Go ahead and wrap <CODE>grades.h</CODE> (i.e., edit <CODE>grades.h</CODE>).
</EM>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Compiling a program made up of multiple parts:</B><P>

Now we would like to compile and link our program, which is made up of
multiple files (header (<CODE>.h</CODE>) and source (<CODE>.c</CODE>)
files).

<P>
We can use <CODE>gcc</CODE> as usual, and just need to specify the
source code files that make up the program...

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -o adjust adjust.c grades.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Note:</B>
We DO NOT list the header files.  Since they are <EM>included</EM> into
source files, they will get compiled.  The <NOBR><CODE>-o
adjust</CODE></NOBR> tells it to give the executable the name
<CODE>adjust</CODE> instead of <CODE>a.out</CODE>.
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
Compiling produces a problem:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
/var/tmp/ccy8x5x_1.o: In function `main':
/var/tmp/ccy8x5x_1.o(.text+0x1e0): undefined reference to `PrintGrades'
/var/tmp/ccy8x5x_1.o(.text+0x21c): undefined reference to `PrintGrades'
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is complaining that there is something called <CODE>PrintGrades()</CODE>
(used in <CODE>main()</CODE>) that is not defined.  <EM>What kind of
error is this?</EM>

<P>
Fix the error by correcting the function name in <CODE>grades.c</CODE>.
Then, recompile:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -o adjust adjust.c grades.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
We now have an executable <CODE>adjust</CODE> that can be run on the
data file <CODE>data1</CODE>.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
adjust &lt; data1
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It should run fine.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=left>

<P>
Notice that after we made a change to the source code in
<CODE>adjust.c</CODE>, we ended up recompiling everything with...

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -o adjust <B>adjust.c grades.c</B>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is wasteful because nothing in <CODE>adjust.c</CODE> changed,
only <CODE>grades.c</CODE>, so why should <CODE>adjust.c</CODE> be
recompiled?!

<P>
<LI>
<A NAME="sep-compile"></A>
<B>Compiling source code <EM>separately</EM>:</B><P>

What we should have been doing instead is compiling source code
to intermediate <EM>object files</EM> and then linking them together.

<P>
First, recall that the program is made up of 3 source files:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>adjust.c</CODE>, a main program.
<LI><CODE>grades.h</CODE>, interface for the grades module.
<LI><CODE>grades.c</CODE>, implementation file for the grades module.
</UL>

<P>
We want to <EM>compile</EM> each piece of the program separately and
then <EM>link</EM> them together.  This will allow us to only
regenerate the parts of the program that are affected when we change some
source code.

<P>
When we <EM>just compile</EM> source code (without linking it
together), it means that we take the <CODE>.c</CODE> files and generate
intermediate <EM>object (<CODE>.o</CODE>) files</EM>.

<P>
To just compile source code, use the <B><CODE>-c</CODE></B> flag
with the compiler...

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c adjust.c
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c grades.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This will generate the object files <CODE>adjust.o</CODE> (for
<CODE>adjust.c</CODE>) and <CODE>grades.o</CODE> (for
<CODE>grades.c</CODE>).  List your files to see the intermediate
<EM>object</EM> (<CODE>.o</CODE>) files.

<P>
Finally, to link the object files (<CODE>.o</CODE>) into an executable
that we can run, we use the compiler again (although this time it will
just pass the <CODE>.o</CODE> files on to the <EM>linking</EM> stage):

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -o adjust adjust.o grades.o
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Remember, we use of the <B><CODE>-o</CODE></B> flags to tell it to call
the executable <CODE>adjust</CODE> instead of <CODE>a.out</CODE>.

<P>
<LI>
<B>Dependency chart:</B><P>

Since we have just compiled the executable <CODE>adjust</CODE>
<EM>separately</EM> on the commandline, we know exactly what commands
are needed to generate the pieces that make up the executable.

<P>
We would like to know under what circumstances we'll have to
regenerate each of those pieces.  For example, if any of the object
(<CODE>.o</CODE>) files get changed, then they have to be relinked into
a new executable. Nonetheless, that's not the only case.

<P>
Let's start from our goal (i.e., to have an executable named
<CODE>adjust</CODE>) and draw a <EM>dependency chart</EM>...

<P>
The executable <B>adjust</B> is made up of the 2 object files,
<B>adjust.o</B> and <B>grades.o</B>.  Thus, <B>adjust</B>
<EM>depends</EM> on those 2 files.  To generate <B>adjust</B> from
those files, we <EM>link</EM> them together.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">        adjust
       /       \
     /    link   \
   /               \
adjust.o       grades.o</FONT>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Next, <B>adjust.o</B> depends on <B>adjust.c</B> and <B>grades.o</B>
depends on <B>grades.c</B>.  You generate these object files by
<EM>compiling</EM> the corresponding <CODE>.c</CODE> files.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
        adjust
       /       \
     /    link   \
   /               \

  |     compile     |
  |                 |
adjust.c       grades.c</FONT>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Finally, the 2 source code files depend on <B>grades.h</B> since they
both <EM>include</EM> that file.  This, however, is a slightly different
dependency since the <CODE>.c</CODE> don't need to be <EM>generated</EM>
like the <CODE>.o</CODE> files and the executable.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
        adjust
       /       \
     /    link   \
   /               \

<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">   \               /

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="40%" ALIGN=left>
We've just listed all the dependencies for the executable
<CODE>adjust</CODE>.  The executable depends on some things
<EM>directly</EM> (like the <CODE>.o</CODE> files) and some things
<EM>indirectly</EM> (i.e., you need the <CODE>.c</CODE> files to make
the <CODE>.o</CODE> files to make the executable).

<P>
Here is the complete <EM>dependency chart</EM>...

<A NAME="depend-chart"></A>

Dependencies go downward.
How to "get" or generate files goes upward.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
With such a dependency chart, we can answer questions about what we
need to regenerate if we change certain files.

<P>
For example, suppose we change the file <CODE>adjust.c</CODE>...
<EM>What has to be regenerated?</EM>

<P><B>Answer:</B> First, recompile <CODE>adjust.c</CODE> to get
<CODE>adjust.o</CODE>.  Then, relink all the object files together
again to get the executable <CODE>adjust</CODE>.

<P>
<EM>Now, suppose we changed <CODE>grades.h</CODE>?</EM>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="40%" ALIGN=left>
Note that when either a <CODE>.c</CODE> file changes or a header file
included by a <CODE>.c</CODE> file changes, we have to regenerate the
corresponding <CODE>.o</CODE> file.
<HR WIDTH="40%" ALIGN=left>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Why Make Utility:</B><P>

Since it is tedious to recompile pieces of a program when something
changes, people often use the <EM>make</EM> utility instead.

<P>
<EM>Make</EM> needs a <EM>make file</EM> that encodes both the
dependencies between files and the commands needed to generate files.

<P>
When you run the <EM>make</EM> utility, it examines the
<EM>modification times</EM> of files and determines what needs to be
regenerated.  Files that are <EM>older</EM> than the files they depend
on must be regenerated.  Regenerating one file may cause others to
become <EM>old</EM>, so that several files end up being regenerated.

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Aside:</B>
Note the difference between the <EM>make utility</EM> (a program you
run) and a <EM>make file</EM> (that tells the <EM>make utility</EM>
how to compile/link a specific program).
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
A make file may either be named <B>Makefile</B> (first letter uppercase)
or <B>makefile</B> (all lowercase).  We will prefer the uppercase form,
<B>Makefile</B>.

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Aside:</B>
Make files can have other file names, but then you'll have to
tell the <EM>make</EM> utility what the name of the make file is (using
a commandline option).
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
It makes things much easier if the make file is in the same directory
as the source code files.  You can create a make file in any text editor.

<P>
Let's look at the <A TARGET=_blank HREF="download/Makefile">make
file</A> for the executable <CODE>adjust</CODE>.

<P>
<LI>
<B>Writing a Make File:</B><P>

For simple make files, there will be at least 2 parts:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A set of <EM>variables</EM>, which will specify things like the
C compiler/linker to use, flags for the compiler, etc.
<LI>A set of <EM>targets</EM>, i.e., files that have to be generated.
</UL>

<P>
Keep in mind that make files use their own <EM>language</EM>, so 
DON'T expect things in them to look like C.

<P>
Make files should have comments so that they are more readable.  In make
files, any line starting with a pound sign (<CODE>#</CODE>) is a
comment, like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# Makefile for executable adjust
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Variables</H4>

The first variable is for the compiler to use...

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
CC = gcc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In general, the form for setting a variable is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
VARNAME = value
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(The space around the <CODE>=</CODE> is optional for our version of make,
but adds to readability).

<P>
The second variable says what flags to pass to the C compiler...

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
CFLAGS = -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here, the variable includes the flag that adds <EM>debugging information</EM>.

<P>
The 2 variables, <CODE>CC</CODE> and <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, are the ones
that our version of <EM>make</EM> expects to be set for the C compiler
and flags to the C compiler, respectively.  You can also use your own
variables, but <EM>make</EM> has a set of standard variables, like
these, that it uses.

<P>
In the next section, <CODE>CC</CODE> and <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> are used
in commands needed to compile/link certain files.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=left>
<B>NOTE:</B> <EM>Make</EM> actually knows how to compile some
things automatically, though it needs variables like <CODE>CC</CODE> to
figure out which compiler to use.  We ignore these automatic
features and write these commands ourselves to help in learning
<EM>make</EM>.
<HR WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=left>

<H4>Targets</H4>

Now that we have the variables we need, we can deal with the targets,
which are files that must be <EM>generated</EM>.

<P>
For each target, there are typically 1 or 2 lines in a make file.
Those lines specify:

<P>
<OL>
<LI>its dependencies (easy to determine from a <A
HREF="#depend-chart">dependency chart</A>)
<LI>and possibly a command to generate the target (easy to determine
from knowledge of <A HREF="#sep-compile">separate compilation</A>).
</OL>

<P>
By default, the first target in the make file is the one that gets
generated when you just say "<CODE>make</CODE>" at the commandline, so
it should be the name of the executable, in our case, <CODE>adjust</CODE>.

<H4>Target: Executable</H4>

Let's examine the first target in our make file (i.e., for
<CODE>adjust</CODE>)...

<P>
For a target's dependency line, the target file name should be listed,
followed by a colon (<B><CODE>:</CODE></B>) and the files it depends on:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
adjust: adjust.o grades.o
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For a target that is an executable, we just list the object files it
depends on.

<P>
On the next line, there should be a command that generates the target:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o adjust adjust.o grades.o 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Note:</B>
This line <B>MUST</B> start with a <CODE>&lt;Tab&gt;</CODE> (i.e., hit
the Tab key)...it cannot start with a regular space!
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<P>
Note that the variables <CODE>C</CODE> and <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> are
used, which means that the command is really:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -o adjust adjust.o grades.o
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">
<B>Note:</B>
Using a variable in a make file involves using the dollar sign
(<CODE>$</CODE>) and then the variable name in parentheses.
<HR ALIGN=left WIDTH="20%">

<H4>Targets: Object Files</H4>

<P>
Our next target is the object file, <CODE>adjust.o</CODE>.

<P>
For a target that is an object file, we list all files it depends on.
This means its corresponding <CODE>.c</CODE> file, plus any header
files its <CODE>.c</CODE> file includes (i.e., include directly or
indirectly, but not system header files like <CODE>stdio.h</CODE> that
aren't going to change).

<P>
So, the dependencies line looks like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
adjust.o: adjust.c grades.h
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The command to generate this target is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c adjust.c
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Finally, the last object file, <CODE>grades.o</CODE> requires:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
grades.o: grades.c grades.h
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c grades.c 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
That's all for the make file!!! It just encodes the dependencies and
the generation commands for 1 executable and its 2 object files.  The
complete make file looks like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# Makefile for executable adjust

# *****************************************************
# Parameters to control Makefile operation

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g

# ****************************************************
# Entries to bring the executable up to date

adjust: adjust.o grades.o
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o adjust adjust.o grades.o 

adjust.o: adjust.c grades.h
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c adjust.c

grades.o: grades.c grades.h
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c grades.c 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B>Aside:</B>
<BR>
In a make file, if we have to continue a line, we cannot just continue
on the next line (like in C).  We must end a line with a <CODE>\</CODE>
(backslash, not the forward slash) to tell make that the line
continues.  So, we could have written the last target as:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
grades.o: grades.c \
           grades.h
<FONT COLOR="#ee0000">&lt;Tab&gt;</FONT>$(CC) \
        $(CFLAGS) -c \
	grades.c 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Only break lines where space would normally go.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="20%" ALIGN=left>

<P>
Also, we have done some extra work.  <EM>Make</EM> already knows that a
<CODE>.o</CODE> can depend on a corresponding <CODE>.c</CODE> file
(among other things).  It also knows how to compile a <CODE>.c</CODE>
file into a <CODE>.o</CODE> (assuming the variables <CODE>CC</CODE> and
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> have been set to the values you want--else it uses
the default compiler).  <EM>Make</EM> does not necessarily know which
header files a <CODE>.c</CODE> file includes, however, so we needed to
include that information ourselves.  Therefore, the last target could
have just been:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
grades.o: grades.h
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
without any generation command needed after it.

<P>
The reason we included the extra pieces of information is so that you
learn how to write complete dependency and generation lines for targets.
<HR>

<P>
<LI>
<B>Using a Make File:</B><P>

Now that we have a make file that encodes the dependencies between the
files that make up the executable, it is easy to compile that executable.

<P>
Try using the make file we've given you.  First, remove the old
executable and object files:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% <B>rm adjust *.o</B>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then, run make with the command:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% <B>make</B>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Remember that this will cause make to generate the <EM>first target</EM>
in the make file, which is <CODE>adjust</CODE>.

<P>
Since nothing has been compiled/linked, it will do:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -c adjust.c
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -c grades.c 
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -o adjust adjust.o grades.o 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I.e., compile the 2 <CODE>.c</CODE> files into object files, and then
link the object files into an executable named <CODE>adjust</CODE>.

<P>
(If you have trouble, make sure that the make file is named
<B>Makefile</B> and is in the same directory as the source code files.)

<P>
Now, type the make command again (let's explicitly tell it what
target to generate this time) and you get:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% <B>make adjust</B>
make: `adjust' is up to date.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here, make tells you nothing has changed, so it has no work to do.

<P>
Next, suppose we want the program to be able to handle at least 20
grades (instead of 10).  Bring up <CODE>adjust.c</CODE> in an editor
and change:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#define MAX_GRADES  10
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

so that it reads 20...

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#define MAX_GRADES  20
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
After the change has been made, when we use make:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% <B>make</B>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -c adjust.c 
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -o adjust adjust.o grades.o 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
it doesn't bother regenerating <CODE>grades.o</CODE>, since the files it
depends on have not changed.

<P>
Finally, try changing <CODE>grades.h</CODE> and then <EM>re-making</EM>...

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
% <B>make</B>
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -c adjust.c
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -c grades.c 
gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -g -o adjust adjust.o grades.o 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Since both <CODE>.c</CODE> files include that header, they both have to
be recompiled and linked together.
